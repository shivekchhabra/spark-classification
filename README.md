## What does this repository contain?
This repository contains a simple code to perform classification on iris dataset using pyspark.

I have used a random forest model, but you can change model and data and tweak accordingly for your usecase.

The idea here was to provide a skeleton for all of you reading and for myself when I work later on some related project :D
